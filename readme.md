In this assignment, do the following:

Task 1:

Implement simple Data Persistence with JPA.

The specification for a Student class is given as:

studentId : long (Primary key)
studentNumber : (required) (e.g. Data values: 000-61-0001, 000-61-0002, etc.)
firstName : (required) (e.g.  Data values: "Anna", "Bob" etc.)

middleName : (is optional) (e.g.  Data values: "Lynn", "" etc.)

lastName: (required) (e.g.  Data values: "Smith", "Galverston" etc.)
cgpa : (is optional) (e.g. Data values: 3.45, 2.87, etc)
dateOfEnrollment (This field contains date values; representing the date of enrollment of the 
student)

Using Spring Boot create a Java console (command-line) application named, MyStudentMgmtApp. And in 
it, implement code for a Java persistent entity/class named, Student, including the data fields as 
has been specified above, and the accessor (getter) methods and mutator (setter) methods, and 
including any needed constructor(s). Make the class be inside a package named, 
edu.miu.cs.cs425.studentmgmt.model.

In the executable class, implement a method named, saveStudent(), which takes as input a Student 
object and it saves/persists it to your database. Add code to the main method, that creates a Student 
object using the following data and invokes the saveStudent() method to save it to the database.

Student data: s1: { studentId:1, studentNumber: 000-61-0001, firstName:Anna, middleName: Lynn, 
LastName: Smith, cgpa:3.45, dateOfEnrollment:2019/5/24 }

Task 2:

1. Add a new entity named, Transcript (transcriptId: primaryKey, degreeTitle) to your solution above. 
Determine the relationship between Student entity and Transcript enity. And then implement JPA code 
for mapping and persisting/saving a student-and-transcript object data. Sample data: Transcript {1, 
"BS Computer Science"}

2. Add a new entity named, Classroom (classroomId: primaryKey, buildingName, roomNumber) to your 
solution above. Determine the relationship between Student entity and Classroom entity. And then 
implement JPA code for mapping and persisting/saving a student-and-classroom object data. Sample 
data: Classroom {1, "McLaughlin building", "M105"}
